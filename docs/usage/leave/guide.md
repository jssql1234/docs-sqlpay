## Introduction

The Leave module is used to monitor employee leave, manage the company calendar, and print attendance reports. It consists of four sections:

1. **Maintenance**
2. **Leave Entitlement Processor**
3. **Leave Application**
4. **Reports**

## Leave Application

- **Records leave applied for by each employee. You can input any type of leave defined in Maintain Leave Type.**
- **You can assign a calendar to individual employees in Maintain Employee. This will load the employee's leave application.**
- It monitors leave applications based on the up-to-date leave entitlement.

    For example:

    1. **Annual Leave Entitlement = 12 days**
    2. **Average Annual Leave Entitlement = 1 day per month**
    3. **Annual Leave applied for a month:**
        - **January = 0 days**
        - **February = 1 day**
        - **March = 0 days**

    In this scenario, the total annual leave entitled up to April is 4 days (including April).

    This means the remaining annual leave is (4 – 1) = 3 days.

    If the employee applies for 4 days of leave in April, the system will prompt the warning: “You’ve taken 5.0 days of Annual Leave, but Annual Leave limit for April is 4.0 days.”

    You can then choose to Allow, Not Allow, or treat it as Unpaid Leave.
    :::

1. Navigate to **Leave** > **Leave Application**.

    ![leave-application](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/leave-application.png)

2. Select the year (e.g., 2015).

    ![leave-application-year](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/leave-application-year.png)

3. Select the employee (e.g., Lee Chong Wai).

    ![leave-application-employee](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/leave-application-employee.png)

4. Click the **+** button. A row will appear where you can select the date, leave type, and number of days applied. Click **Save** once completed.

    ![leave-application-date](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/leave-application-date.png)
    ![leave-application-save](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/leave-application-save.png)

5. If the employee applies for half-day leave or hourly leave, use the **Day As Time** column (1 working day = 8 working hours).

    ![leave-application-halfday](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/leave-application-halfday.png)

6. Enter the duration (e.g., 3 hours). The system will automatically calculate the number of days (e.g., 0.38 days).

    ![leave-application-hours](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/leave-application-hours.png)

### Hourly Leave Application

1. Go to **Leave** > **Leave Application** > **New Leave Application**.

    ![hour-leave-new](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/hour-leave-new.png)

2. Select the employee's name, then click **Apply Leave**.

    ![hour-leave-select-employee](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/hour-leave-select-employee.png)

3. Enable the **Day As Time** column.

    ![hour-leave-day-as-time](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/hour-leave-day-as-time.png)

4. Select the leave type and date.

    - The **Day** column represents the number of days, while the **Day As Time** column represents the hours.
      :::tip Example:
      - Day = 1.00 (1 day of leave)
      - Day As Time = 8.00 (HH:MM, 8 hours in 1 day)
      :::

    ![hour-leave-select-type](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/hour-leave-select-type.png)

5. Apply Hourly Leave.

    - If a staff member wants to apply for 2 hours of Annual Leave, enter `02:00` in the **Day As Time** column and press **Enter**.

    - The **Day** column will automatically update to `0.25`.

    ![hour-leave-apply](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/hour-leave-apply.png)

6. Save.

    - Click the **Save** icon. The save is complete when the icon turns grey.

    ![bf-leave-calculation-4](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/bf-leave-calculation-4.png)

    <details>
    <summary>Standard vs Custom Calculation</summary>

    #### Standard Calculation
    An easy-to-use interface that allows users to configure BF Leave, including setting a fixed
    maximum number of carry-forward days and defining a special expiry date by which the BF
    leave must be utilized.

    1. Tick this option and set the maximum days allowed carry forward to the next year. 
        ![bf-leave-calculation-5](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/bf-leave-calculation-5.png)
        > Tips: If you do not have the BF limit, you may ignore this step.

    2. Tick the option to set the expiry date, and select the Month and Day
        ![bf-leave-calculation-6](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/bf-leave-calculation-6.png)
        BF Leave balance will be considered forfeit at the next day of the expiry date.
        For this sample : Leave Expiry Date - 31/03, Leave Forfeit - 01/04
        > Tips: If you do not have Bring Forward leave with an expiry date, you may ignore this step.

    #### Custom Calculation
    Extensive BF leave calculation logic is implemented through scripting and is generally
    developed by a programmer.

    1. Select this calculation method, and click the dropdown icon to load in the script

## Maintain Leave Group

:::info Features

- Allows you to customize leave policies for different employee levels.
- You can customize scripts (under **Tools** > **Maintain Script**) and apply them to the leave group.

:::

1. Navigate to **Leave** > **Maintain Leave Group**.

    ![maintain-leave-group](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/maintain-leave-group.png)

2. Click the **New** button in the top right corner.

    ![maintain-leave-group-new](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/maintain-leave-group-new.png)

3. Assign a code for the new leave group.

    :::tip Example
    `FW` for Foreign Worker.

    Click the **+** button to select the entitled leave types for this group.
    :::

    ![maintain-leave-group-code](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/maintain-leave-group-code.png)

4. Taking **Annual Leave (AL)** as an example:

    - By default, the calculation for Annual Leave is:

    | Year of Service (Years) | Day of Leave Entitled (Days) |
    | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | 1 to 2                  | 8                            |
    | 3 to 4                  | 12                           |
    | >4                      | 16                           |

    ![maintain-leave-default-al](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/maintain-leave-default-al.png)

    If your company follows this default policy, go to the **Entitle** tab and select **Annual Leave Entitlement Policy**. The calculation will follow the default setting.

    ![maintain-leave-group-policy](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/maintain-leave-group-policy.png)

    Click **Save**.

5. If your company uses a different policy, click **Edit**, then click the **...** button beside the **Entitle** column to customize the calculation.

    ![maintain-leave-group-entitle](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/maintain-leave-group-entitle.png)

6. For example, if your company uses the following calculation:

    | Year of Service (Years) | Day of Leave Entitled (Days) |
    | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | 1 to 2                  | 8                            |
    | 3 to 5                  | 12                           |
    | >5                      | 18                           |

    Enter the table as follows:

    | Year From | Year To | Days |
    | --------- | ------- | ---- |
    | 1         | 2       | 8    |
    | 3         | 5       | 12   |
    | 1         | 99      | 18   |

    ![maintain-leave-group-entitilement-new](../../../static/img/usage/leave-module/maintain-leave-group-entitilement-new.png)

7. Click **OK** to finish. 🥳

### Employee Leave Group Assignment
