## Leave Approval

### 1. If multiple managers approve the same leave request, will the leave be deducted multiple times?

**Scenario:**

- **Manager A** and **Manager B** both have approval authority for the Accounts Department.
- **Staff C** (Accounts Department) submits a leave request.
- Both **Manager A** and **Manager B** approve the same leave request.

**Question:**

How many days of leave will be deducted from the employee's balance?

**Answer:**

The leave will only be deducted **once**. The system treats it as a single transaction, regardless of how many managers approve the specific request.
