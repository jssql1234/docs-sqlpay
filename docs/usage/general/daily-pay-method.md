7. Check the overtime records

   1. Click on the Overtime to retrieve the detailed wages records.
   2. You will see the records are posted from Overtime pending for the month.
      - Working Day Per Month = 1 (from Maintain Contribution)
      - Working Hour Per Day = 8 (from Maintain Contribution)
      - Wages = RM16.00 (from Maintain Employee)

   Based on the above information,

   - Daily Pay Rate = RM16.00 / 1 day = RM16.00 per day
   - Hourly Pay Rate = RM16.00 / 8 hrs = RM2.00 per hour

   Therefore, the overtime calculation is

   |Code|Work Unit|Rate|Pay Rate|OT Pay Rate|Amount|
   |:--:| :-----: |:--:|:------:|:---------:|:----:|
   |HW15|4hrs|1.5|2.00|RM2.00 x 1.5 = RM3.00|RM3.00 x 4 hrs = RM12.00|
   |HW15|4hrs|1.5|2.00|RM2.00 x 1.5 = RM3.00|RM3.00 x 3 hrs = RM9.00|
