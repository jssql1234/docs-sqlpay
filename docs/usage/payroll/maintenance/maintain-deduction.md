## Introduction

:::info Feature

Maintain Deductions is used to configure employee payroll deductions, such as personal loan deductions, company advance deductions, lateness deductions, and restaurant deductions.

Deductions can be fixed amounts or percentages; once configured, they are automatically deducted from payroll.

Deductions may affect net pay, tax calculations, and the inclusion or exclusion of contributions such as EPF/SOCSO. These settings should be based on company policies and regulations.
