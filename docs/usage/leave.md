4. Taking **Annual Leave (AL)** as an example.

   - By default, the calculation for ‚ÄúAnnual Leave‚Äù is as such:

   | Year of Service (Years) | Day of Leave Entitled (Days) |
   | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
   | 1 to 2                  | 8                            |
   | 3 to 4                  | 12                           |
   | >4                      | 16                           |

   ![maintain-leave-default-al](../../static/img/usage/leave-module/maintain-leave-default-al.png)

   If your company‚Äôs annual leave policy follows this default setting, you can point to the **Entitle** tab and select **Annual Leave Entitlement Policy**. With that, the calculation will follow the default setting.

   ![maintain-leave-group-policy](../../static/img/usage/leave-module/maintain-leave-group-policy.png)

   Click **Save**.

5. If your company does not follow the default annual leave setting, you can always customise your own calculation by clicking on **Edit**, and then the 3 dots beside the **entitle** column

   ![maintain-leave-group-entitle](../../static/img/usage/leave-module/maintain-leave-group-entitle.png)

6. For example, your company complies to the calculation as below.

   | Year of Service (Years) | Day of Leave Entitled (Days) |
   | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
   | 1 to 2                  | 8                            |
   | 3 to 5                  | 12                           |
   | >5                      | 18                           |

   Thus, you need to key in the table as such:

   | Year From | Year To | Days |
   | --------- | ------- | ---- |
   | 1         | 2       | 8    |
   | 3         | 5       | 12   |
   | 1         | 99      | 18   |
