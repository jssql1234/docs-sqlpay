This could happened in a scenario where a staff resigns this month but has pending commissions or claims that will be distributed in the following month, how do we process these transactions?

- For example, the picture below shows that staff has resign on 15/07/2021. There is 1 pending commission transaction for 31/08/2021. How do we process this?
