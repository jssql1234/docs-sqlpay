- After ***'Update Payroll'***, all OT / Leave trans that has been assigned action will no longer appear on the grid. User may view it under [Time Attendance Unassigned Listing report](payroll-report.md#time-attendance-unassigned-listing)

:::info
The **'ETMS updated to dd/mm/yyyy'** is the date of the latest TMS summary processed. Any attendance logs before the updated date will no longer allowed to be adjusted from SQL HRMS app.

If user sync before 9am, Time Attendance Log will only sync up to two days before.
