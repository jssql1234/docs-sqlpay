:::info
The **'ETMS updated to dd/mm/yyyy'** is the date of the latest TMS summary processed. Any attendance logs before the updated date will no longer allowed to be adjusted from SQL HRMS app.

The **Log synced to dd/mm/yyyy hh:nn** is the date time SQL Payroll will sync attendance log to. Any attendance logs before this time (due to manager clock on behalf) will no longer be synced to SQL Payroll
