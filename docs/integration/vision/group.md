# Group

:::info[Note]

This feature is only available to **manager**.

:::

## Introduction

**Group** is a feature that allows manager to do grouping in advance. These groups can then be applied when creating a *Target, Assignment or Upskill* without requiring manager to select the members individually.

## Manage Group

Manager can view all the created groups in **Main Dashboard | Manage Group**. In this page, manager can **search**, **add**, **edit** and **delete** group.

## Apply Group

Group can be applied when creating a [**Target**](task/manager_view/task_creation/target#step-3---participants-information), [**Assignment (Step 3)**](task/manager_view/task_creation/assignment#step-3---participants-information) or an [**Upskill (Step 4)**](upskill/manager_view/upskill-creation#step-4---participants-information).

![Manage Group - Apply](../../../static/img/integration/vision/group/g-apply.png)

1. Tap **Group** icon.
2. Select the group that you want to apply. You can select multiple groups.
3. Tap **Apply**. You will see the selected groups members appear in the list.


:::info[Note 1]

When multiple groups are selected, the Roles of duplicated Group Members will be applied according to the **last selected group**.

Example:

- **Group A:** Member A (No Role)
- **Group B:** Member A (Admin)

1. **Selecting A then B** → Member A becomes **Admin**.
2. **Selecting B then A** → Member A becomes **No Role**."

:::info[Note 2]

When a group is applied to an **assignment, upskill, or individual target**, the **Group Leader** role of any member in that group will be **automatically removed**.
