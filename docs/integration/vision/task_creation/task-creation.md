# Introduction

:::info[Note]
This feature is only available to **managers**.
:::

The Task Creation feature allows managers to create new missions for employees. There are two types of missions: **Assignment** and **Target**.

- **Assignment:**  
  An Assignment mission focuses on qualitative outcomes that require creativity and strategic thinking. These missions emphasize the quality of work and the process rather than measurable results. E.g. Idea brainstorm, Clothes design..

- **Target:**  
  A Target mission centers on quantitative outcomes with specific, measurable goals. The focus is on achieving clear, countable results. E.g. Sales Target, Total new users.

- **Quest:**  
  A Quest is used when youâ€™re unsure who to assign a task to or want to invite all employees to participate.
