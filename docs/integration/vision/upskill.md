# Upskill

## Concept

### 1. Rewards Type  

#### **Rewards by Completion**
  - Rewards are issued when participants achieve full attendance across all sessions (100% attendance).
  - Participants can view their session reward only after the all sessions has ended, as the reward depends on their overall attendance.

  :::info[Note]
  By default, a course with only one session is considered "reward by completion."
  :::

  :::danger[Warning]
  Participants will not receive any reward if they miss any session in a completion-based course.
  :::

<br/>

#### **Rewards by Session**
  - Rewards are issued once participants attend any session.
  - Participants can view their updated reward immediately after each session ended.

  :::info[Note]
  Session-based course requires at least two sessions.
  :::

<br/>
### 2. Course visibility
- The diagram below illustrates how course visibility is set for branches, departments, and HR groups.  
![Visibility Diagram](../../../static/img/integration/vision/upskill/concept_courseVisibility_setVisibility.png)

#### **User Visibility**
- Participants can view courses open to their own branch, department, and HR group.
- However, participants can join courses from other branches, departments, or HR groups if a manager manually adds them to the course.

#### **Manager Visibility**
- Managers can only **manage** courses involving the **branch and department that are under their management area** which is set in payroll. 
- For **other branches and departments**, managers can only **view** the course information **without reward details**.
