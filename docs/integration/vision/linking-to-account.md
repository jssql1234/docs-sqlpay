## Strategy

The **Strategy** is a formula that helps managers and the application categorize specific targets for each mission. This setup allows the application to accurately retrieve the target amounts associated with a mission from the SQL Account system. 

To view the strategy, go to **Main Dashboard | Side Bar | Company Configuration**

:::tip Example Scenario

Suppose youâ€™re managing a Sales Department and want to track Q1 sales targets:

1. For the mission **"Achieve Q1 Sales Target"**, assign the **"Invoice Based Strategy"** strategy.

2. With this setup, managers can update sales progress daily in SQL Vision using SQL Vision Sync tool by mapping it to the correct Strategy ID. Managers can then view the updated progress daily in SQL Vision.

### Pre-defined Strategy

By default, SQL Vision automatically adds two pre-defined strategies to a newly created company, as shown in the image below:

If the system encounters an error and fails to create the pre-defined strategies, you can manually add them by navigating to the **Company Configuration** section. When this issue occurs, the application will display a dialog box prompting you to add the default strategies manually, as shown in the image below:
