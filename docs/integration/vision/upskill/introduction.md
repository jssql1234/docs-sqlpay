# Introduction

Upskill is a module that allows employees to learn new skills by joining courses. **Managers** *can create courses, set rewards, edit course details, mark attendance, approve bonus requests, and finalise the course*. **Employees** can *view available courses, register for a course, request bonuses, and view the rewards they have earned throughout the course*.

### Rewards Type

#### **Rewards by Completion**

- Rewards are issued when participants **achieve full attendance** across all sessions *(100% attendance)*.
- Participants can view their session reward only after the all sessions has ended, as the reward depends on their overall attendance.

:::info[Note]
By default, a course with only one session is considered **"Reward by Completion"**.
:::

:::danger[Warning]
Participants will not receive any session reward if they missed any session in a completion-based course.
:::

#### **Rewards by Session**

- Rewards are issued once participants **attend any session**.
- Participants can view their updated reward immediately after each session ended.

:::info[Note]
Session-based course requires **at least two sessions**.
:::

### Course Role

#### **Admin**

- The **course creator** is automatically assigned as the first admin and cannot be removed.
- Admin holds the **highest** level of **privileges** in the course.
- They can perform all actions including *editing course details, managing participants, marking attendance, and approving bonus requests*.

#### **Tutor**

- The **lead instructor** of the course.
- Each course can have **only one** tutor.
- Tutors hold the second-highest level of privileges, after admins.
- **Except for reward-related details** — such as tutor and assistant assignments, Step 3 reward settings, and admin roles, tutors can perform **same actions as admin**.

:::info[Note]
Tutors cannot edit reward-related course details or assign tutors, assistant tutors, or admins.
:::

#### **Assistant**

- There can be **multiple** assistants in a course.
- Assistants hold the **same level of privileges as tutor**.
- Multiple assistant tiers can be created, each with different reward allocations.

#### **Participant**

- Employees who have registered for the course.
- Participants can view their attendance records, request bonuses, and track rewards earned.

### Course Visibility

- The dashboard contains two buttons: upskill and manage upskill.  
  **Upskill**: Displays courses where the employee is a **participant, tutor, or assistant**.  
  **Manage Upskill**: Displays courses where the employee is assigned as **admin**.
  ![Visibility Diagram](../../../../static/img/integration/vision/upskill/concept_courseVisibility.png)

:::info[Note]

- Employees who are **not managers** cannot view **others’ upskill** or create courses.

![Visibility Diagram](../../../../static/img/integration/vision/upskill/concept_courseVisibility_manageUpskillTab.png)
:::

#### **User Visibility**

- Participants can view courses open to exactly their own branch, department, and HR group.
- However, participants still can join courses from other branches, departments, or HR groups if a manager manually adds them to the course.
- The diagram below illustrates how course visibility is set for branches, departments, and HR groups.

![Visibility Diagram](../../../../static/img/integration/vision/upskill/concept_courseVisibility_setVisibility.png)

#### **Manager Visibility**

- Employees can only manage courses where they are assigned as admin. To understand more about admin, [<u>click here</u>](#course-role)
- Courses where they are not admins will appear under the **others' upskill view** where managers can only **view** the public course information **without reward details**.

### Course Privacy

#### **Public course**

- A public course is visible to participants in specific branches, departments, or HR groups as set by the manager [<u>here</u>](#course-visibility).
- It allows eligible participants to register on their own.

#### **Private course**

- A private course is not open for general registration.
- Instead, participants are manually added by the manager.
- Only those who are added to the course can view it in the course tab *(registered or completed tab)*.
