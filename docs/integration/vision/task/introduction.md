# Introduction

There are 3 types of missions in task module: **Assignment**, **Target** and **Quest**.

- **Assignment:**  
  An Assignment mission focuses on qualitative outcomes that require creativity and strategic thinking. These missions emphasize the quality of work and the process rather than measurable results.
  
  *Example: Marketing Strategy Planning, Company Logo design.*

- **Target:**  
  A Target mission centers on quantitative outcomes with specific, measurable goals. The focus is on achieving clear, countable results. 
  
  *Example: Sales Target, Input Data.*

- **Quest:**  
  A Quest is ideal when the participant is not predetermined or when you want to invite all employees to participate.
